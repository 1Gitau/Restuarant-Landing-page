# Collaboration Guide for Restaurant Landing Page Project

## Project Overview
We are a team of five tasked with creating a restaurant landing page. Each member will be responsible for one component of the page. The components are as follows:
- Hero
- About Us
- Footer & Header
- Menu
- Testimonials

## Collaboration Tools
We will use the following tools to collaborate effectively:
- **GitHub**: For version control and code collaboration.


## GitHub Workflow
1. **Repository Setup**: One member will create a GitHub repository and invite the other members as collaborators. Kingjames has been tasked with this.
2. **Cloning the Repository**: Each member should clone the repository to their local machine using the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kingjames500/Restuarant-Landing-page.git
    ```
3. **Branching Strategy**: Each member will create a branch for their component. For example, `feature/hero`, `feature/about-us`, etc. Use the following command to create and switch to a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/branch-name
    ```
4. **Making Changes**: Implement your component and commit your changes with descriptive messages:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add hero section"
    ```
5. **Pushing Changes**: Push your branch to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/branch-name
    ```
6. **Pull Requests**: Once a component is complete, the member will create a pull request to merge their branch into the `main` branch. Navigate to the repository on GitHub, go to the "Pull requests" tab, and click "New pull request".
7. **Code Reviews**: Each member should review at least one pull request from another member to ensure code quality and consistency. Provide feedback and approve the pull request if everything looks good.

8. **Rendering Components**: To render the component you have worked on, follow these steps:
    - Ensure your component is correctly implemented and committed.
    - Import your component into the main application file (e.g., `App.jsx` ).
    - Add your component to the appropriate section of the page layout.
    - Test the integration locally to ensure it displays as expected.
